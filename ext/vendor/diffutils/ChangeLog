	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

2010-05-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: use gnulib's sys_wait module
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Use gnulib's sys_wait module,
	now that we assume its presence.

2010-04-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest
	* bootstrap: Also update from gnulib.
	* tests/init.sh: Likewise

	* src/system.h: Include <sys/wait.h> unconditionally,
	now that gnulib guarantees its presence.
	* lib/cmpbuf.c: Likewise for <unistd.h> and <inttypes.h>.

2010-04-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: use original no-newline-at-eof test, but with -U1, not -U2
	* tests/no-newline-at-eof: Revert to the smaller test, but with
	-U1 rather than -U2, since that actually triggers the bug.

2010-04-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Followon improvements for the fix for Debian bug 577832.
	* src/io.c (find_and_hash_each_line): Omit the inserted newline in
	a simpler way.
	* tests/no-newline-at-eof: Fix the test case so that it rejects
	the old, buggy behavior.

2010-04-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	tests: test for the no-newline-at-EOF bug
	* tests/no-newline-at-eof: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	diff: fix a regression when at least one input lacks a newline-at-EOF,
	and the final hunk plus context-length aligns exactly with the end
	of the newline-lacking file.  Diff would fail to output the required
	"\ No newline at end of file" line, thus rendering the output invalid.
	This bug appears to have been introduced by 2006-05-07
	commit 58d0483b, "(find_identical_ends): Fix huge performance bug...",
	at least to the extent that reverting that change fixes the bug.
	Considering the stated effect of that change and lack of metrics,
	reverting it is not an option, so here we take a more direct approach.

	Given these inputs,

	    printf '\n1'>a; printf '\n0\n\n1'>b

	and running diff like this:

	    ./diff -U1 a b

	for input file "b", the pointer, files[1].linbuf[4][-1], to
	the last byte on the final line was mistakenly pointing at the
	sentinel newline at EOF, rather than at the preceding byte.

	  (gdb) p files[1].linbuf[4][-1]
	  $3 = 10 '\n'

	Thus, this test in the final print_1_line call:

	  if ((!line_flag || line_flag[0]) && limit[-1] != '\n')
	    fprintf (out, "\n\\ %s\n", _("No newline at end of file"));

	would fail, because limit[-1] (which is files[1].linbuf[4][-1])
	was mistakenly '\n', rather than the desired '1'.

	My first thought was simply to adjust the final linbuf[line] setting,
	at the end of io.c's find_and_hash_each_line function function:

	       if (p == bufend)
	-       break;
	+       {
	+         if (current->missing_newline)
	+           --linbuf[line];
	+         break;
	+       }

	But that would make diff misbehave with this input
	(same as above, but with a newline appended to "a"),

	    printf '\n1\n'>a; printf '\n0\n\n1'>b
	    ./diff -U1 a b

	due to the block (100 lines above) that is triggered in that case
	(but not in the both-files-missing-newline case):

	      if (p == bufend
	          && current->missing_newline
	          && ROBUST_OUTPUT_STYLE (output_style))
	        {
	          /* This line is incomplete.  If this is significant,
	             put the line into buckets[-1].  */
	          if (ignore_white_space < IGNORE_SPACE_CHANGE)
	            bucket = &buckets[-1];

	          /* Omit the inserted newline when computing linbuf later.  */
	          p--;
	          bufend = suffix_begin = p;
	        }

	Note how "p" is decremented and "bufend" adjusted.
	When that happens, we certainly don't want to decrement
	"bufend" yet again.

	Since there is no other way to determine at the end whether "bufend"
	was already decremented, add a new variable to serve as witness.

	* src/diff.c (print_context_function): For languages like Ada
	that allow local functions and procedures, the plain context
	function line may start with enough blank characters that the
	function name does not get completely printed in the 40
	characters limit.  This patch solves this problem by removing

	maint: change use of "|" to more maintainable "||" (no semantic change)
	* src/analyze.c (diff_2_files): Using the "||" operator happens to

	This was introduced via 2009-12-17 commit e58efa5b
	"build: enable warnings and -Werror.",
